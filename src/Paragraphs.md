Self-learning Software Developer.

I'm a second-year student at the Communication department. I study in the Faculty of Engineering-Alexandria University. 
Self-learner, writer, and in love with talking to people and hearing their stories.

I chose to be a software developer, because I really enjoy the process of solving problems, also the field is so versatile, and this gives me a huge challenge to work in.

Whenever I see a good scene, I always use my phone camera to capture it. Unfortunately, good moments always pass, but memories last forever.

I love writing and communicating my thoughts. I'm currently writing at dev.to check it out!.

#### Activities

Last year, I participated in ECPC, as I fall in love with algorithms, and problem-solving; It was a nice experience, and I enjoyed working with my team. It gave me the chance to know beautiful personalities, and opened my mind to a lot of new ideas!

I'm currently participating as a student rep in my department. I chose this, as it gives me a chance to help and connect with other students, and to build the community that I always strived for!
